#Ecoregions Data

I’ve been puzzling out the relationships between Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Biomes/Ecozones/Ecoregions/EcoIDs.

Was very excited to discover some EcoIDs already in the wild as MachineTags on flickr, but am slightly irritated to discover that the Terrestrial, Freshwater and Marine Ecoregion systems don’t share a numbering system format. /headdesk.

Anyway: I have found the attached comprehensive list in excel format, from  http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/ecoregional.shapefile  Which I think is the same classification system as the WWF one.
Yay.

To see the flickr tagged content,  http://husk.org/code/machine-tag-browser.html#tag=wwf:ecoregion=na1202 (you may need to scroll down and select wwf in the first column.

More Ecoregion data sources are listed in the data sources spreadsheet:
