LPR 2012: The Ecological Footprint, graphs and data tables
© 2011 Global Footprint Network


**EF = Ecologicial Footprint**

Ecological Footprint = a measure of how much biologically productive land and water an individual, population or activity requires to produce all the resources it consumes, and to absorb the waste it generates, using prevailing technology and resource management practices (and it's measured in global hectares).


**BC = Biocapacity**

**HDI = Human Development Index?**

Human Development Index = a summary composite index that measures a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health, knowledge and a decent standard of living. 
The HDI contains three components:


1. Health: Life expectancy at birth (number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of birth were to stay the same throughout the child's life).


2. Knowledge: A combination of the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio).


3. Standard of living: GDP per capita (PPP US$).

Contains:
* Global EF layer graph
* Global EF and BC plot
* EF vs population plot – for geographic regions
* Long EF graph – all countries ranked
* Pie chart of contribution to global EF from geographic regions
* EF by Income Group
* Map of EF for 1961 and 2008
* Map of BC for 2008
* Long BC graph – all countries ranked
* Pie chart of contribution to global BC from geographic regions
* HDI-EF – weighted by population, but with trails for BRIICS
* Scenario – BAU to 2050

I've had a look at the data and I wondered if the following three tabs on the 'LPR graphs' spreadsheet might be a good place to start:



1) Scenario to 2050 - see 'Projecting the ecological footprint of Planet Earth to 2050' on p100 of LPR).
Uses footprint data between 1961 and 2008 as a baseline, and projects the size of each component of the footprint in 2015, 2030 and 2050.



2) Pivot table - shows each country's Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint per capita and in global hectares for every year from 1961-2008 (although data not available from every country for some years).



3) HDI Raw Data - shows the Human Development Index for every country from 1980-2010 (although data is recorded every five years until 2000, and not every country has data recorded).
