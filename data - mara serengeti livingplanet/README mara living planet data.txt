Living Planet Index Data: update

They've been a bit slow getting back to me and I have uncovered the reason - they are busy working on getting an online interface to the LPI data sorted!  This will be open source BUT it won't be available until mid/late November (in a test format only).

Not much help for the prototype stage but bodes well for future stuff as this is essentially a joint WWF/ZSL thing so we have equal "rights" - if that counts for anything when it's open source anyway!  I will keep an eye open just in case it does become available sooner than later.

In the meantime the ZSL guy (third person I've spoken too!) Is getting me the data for Mara/Serengetti region - a dump which basically includes the "count" (population), "frequency" (of the count) and hopefully also geo-reference for where it was done.  I am getting this "soon as he can find time to run the request".

It is an Access database.

Polar stuff will take longer and is a bigger ask for them so I asked them to concentrate on the Mara stuff for now.  IF we get it in time and IF it is helpful then we can go back and ask for more.
Ben, the ZSL guy, was very helpful and happy to answer further question or talk directly to developers.

At last I have the LPI data for Mara/Serengeti.  Attached here.  Looks quite self explanatory - focus on the common name, location, unit description and then you have a load of dates with related unit counts.  Any queries let me know.
