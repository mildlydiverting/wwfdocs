Mara Water Sonde Data

#Background info From Colin:

We have through a lot of the water data that we need for the flow recommendations but I’m just checking with a couple of our freshwater experts if my assumptions are correct before sending over. 

>In the meantime here is a sample table of the kind of information we should get live from the Mara River. Again I’m just doublechecking which fields we will ultimately want to use but if this is useful for the meantime to give you an idea of what the type of thing will look like

I have attached two months of sonde data to this email. The “discharge” column will not actually be included with the uplinked sonde data but the web guys could probably figure out how to generate it. As part of the uplink kit, I’m asking them to send a depth probe for the sonde that we will install here in the field. The web guys could then generate the discharge based on the depth data and the regression that we have developed.

I’ve asked Colin to follow up on the maths / algorithm needed for this calculation.

In regards to installation extras, we will likely need to purchase some items to help install the sonde at the bridge so that it will survive the high flows of March. Our current installation was never meant to be permanent and it needs frequent attention. We will need to speak with Brian and potentially get some assistance from his fundi (engineer) on the best way forward. I’m envisioning that perhaps WWF-UK could go ahead and purchase the uplink kit then we could cover the installation costs and get reimbursed later (probably only a few hundred dollars). As soon as the uplink kit arrives, we could work on getting it installed…and probably have it up and running within a week.


We are currently using a Bushnell Trophy Cam Max HD - http://www.bushnell.com/all-products/trail-cameras/trophy-cam/trophy-cam-hd-max. 

There is a feed of their images in the brain:

#About using the data

I would recommend that for the live data feed we include the Dissolved O % saturation (col C), turbidity (col F), temperature (col M) and discharge (col O, although I note from the email exchange that I was forwarded that this is not going be included in the upload, there was a suggestion that it could be generated – I guess from the level of water, but this would need to be clarified). If we are going to restrict ourselves to a few variables then these are the easiest ones to understand and explain to the general public.
In terms of putting them into a historical context to gauge the health of the river, there seem to be enough data to do this for flow but I can’t find any long enough time series for the water quality parameters I’ve suggested that would let us do this: it seems that there is only monthly-ish data for 2008 and 2009. An alternative is just to define threshold standards for high/med/low etc. using expert judgement for what a river like the Mara should be. I could make some suggestions based on work I did in West Africa and we could circulate to the researchers working there for them to refine/adjust. What do you think?
For the flow, I think we should show the current flow levels against the maintenance flow recommendations of the environmental flow assessment for the river (p 31 ftp://ftp.globalwaters.net/mara.globalwaters.net/EFA/Database/Consultancy%20Reports/EFA/Follow-up%20EFA/EFA%20Final%20Report,%202009.pdf). This sets a flow level for each month that is required to maintain the health of the river and so would be a good reference standard. But we would also need to somehow show typical conditions too, by showing the mean monthly flow levels (and perhaps the maximum and minimum – ‘Monthly min, max,mean_BBM3’ tab in file BBM3_FDC) – assuming that the monitoring site is at or near the BBM3 site, which if I recall correctly is where Johannah said it was.
